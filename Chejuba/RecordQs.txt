Why should we hire you?
Hi myself prakhar here, you should hire me because i can automate mundane repeating task
of colleagues very easily and implement new features very quickly by getting my hands 
dirty on new technologies like python and react js. I also understand the importance of
creating an scalable web applications.
I also can discover bugs easily by going through someone else's code and open to 
implement my own code by improving every single day.

Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.
A time I remember when I had to learn something quickly was doing the automation work 
of implementation of printing thousands of barcodes.Since there was a time constraint
of implementing this in a short period of time.I solved the problem with the help of 
dynamic programming to store the states of barcodes and print them in minutes instead
of hours. Later on I moved on towards making an executable version of software by 
implementing a GUI in windows.
